			<p>I am a COO of an experiential marketing agency which basically means I solve problems people dont know they have in ways they dont understand. I deal with demanding clients, dwindling budgets and emotional millenials. 
			I deliver innovative creative only to have clients and their legal departments pair it down to a soul crushing shadow of what the creative once was. What can I say I love it. 
			I grew up on the mean streets of Hollywood California attended catholic school for most of my life where I learned the virtues of chastity and knee length skirts and the saving grace of communion wine. I attended San Diego State University</p>
