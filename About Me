About Me
I am a COO of an experiential marketing agency which basically means I solve problems people dont know they have in ways they dont understand. I deal with demanding clients dwindling budgets and emotional millenials. 
I deliver innovative creative only to have clients and their legal departments pair it down to a soul crushing shadow of what the creative once was.
